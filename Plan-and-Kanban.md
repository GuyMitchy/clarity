Colors:

Blue
Considered the most calming color for the mind, blue can help calm the mind, reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, and slow the heart rate. 

Pink
Considered the most physically soothing color, pink can promote tranquility and peace. A slight pink with warm undertones can feel like a warm hug. Baker–Miller pink, also known as P-618, Schauss pink, or Drunk-Tank Pink, is a tone of pink that can temporarily reduce hostile, violent, or aggressive behavior. 


Color use in design:

Primary Colors:

Soft Blue: A calming, light blue inspired by the "most calming color for the mind"
Gentle Pink: A soothing pink tone, similar to Baker-Miller pink but slightly warmer


Secondary Colors:

White: For background and to create a clean, open feel
Light Gray: For text and subtle accents


Accent Color:

Deeper Blue: For buttons and important interactive elements



Soft Blue: #A0D2EB
Gentle Pink: #FFC0CB
White: #FFFFFF
Light Gray: #F0F0F0
Deeper Blue: #5E9DC8

This color scheme provides a balance of calming blues and soothing pinks, with neutral tones to ensure readability and a clean design. The deeper blue can be used for interactive elements to provide clear visual cues for users.
