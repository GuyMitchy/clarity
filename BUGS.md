BACKGROUND IMAGE TOO SHORT-----------------(Partial fix positoned image differntly not happy with result thogh)

Hero background image isnt tall enough so when the hamburger opens and it pushes it down you get the bottom half of the image and the rest is grey.


Rremove padding from containers so nav and hero are full width

Center the card in the contiainer

Make space above the cards for when they grow

Journaling image in carousel is taller than the rest.
